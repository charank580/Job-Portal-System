# DESCRIPTION:

The Job Portal System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It is designed to connect candidates looking for employment opportunities with employers who want to post jobs, while also providing admin functionality for moderation. The project delivers an end-to-end workflow starting from job creation to application submission, resume parsing, and analytics.

At the core, the application provides job listings and applications. Employers can register on the platform, log in, and post job openings with details such as title, description, location, and skills required. Candidates can browse these job postings and apply directly through the portal. This establishes a simple yet powerful recruitment flow similar to popular job sites.

A key highlight of the system is the resume parsing and job matching feature. Candidates can upload their resume text or a simple document, which the backend processes using a parsing routine. Skills, keywords, and qualifications are extracted from the resume. These are then matched against the job requirements posted by employers. The candidate receives immediate feedback on which of their skills align with the job, while employers can quickly view the skill matches for each applicant. Although simplified in this prototype, the feature demonstrates the potential of automated applicant screening and matching, a highly sought-after function in recruitment technology.

The platform is organized into separate dashboards for different user roles.

Candidate Dashboard: Allows candidates to manage their profiles, upload resumes, and track their job applications.

Employer Dashboard: Provides employers with tools to create and manage job postings, as well as view applications for each job.

Admin Panel: Enables administrators to moderate the system by deactivating inappropriate job posts, monitoring user activity, and viewing system analytics.

Analytics are generated to give admins insights into platform usage, such as the total number of jobs posted, users registered, and applications submitted. This creates a data-driven perspective of the platformâ€™s performance.

The system also includes an advanced add-on: LinkedIn API integration. Using OAuth 2.0, candidates can import their LinkedIn profiles directly into the portal. This eliminates the need for manual entry of education, work experience, and skills. With LinkedIn integration, the portal becomes more user-friendly, enabling professionals to instantly create rich profiles. This feature highlights the use of third-party APIs to enhance system functionality and shows how external data sources can be integrated into a MERN stack application.

From a technical perspective:

MongoDB stores data such as users, jobs, and applications in collections.

Express.js handles the backend routes and APIs for authentication, job posting, applying, and analytics.

React.js powers the frontend, providing a dynamic interface for browsing jobs, applying, and interacting with dashboards.

Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the backend logic, authentication, and LinkedIn API integration.

In summary, this Job Portal System demonstrates the practical application of the MERN stack in building a modern recruitment platform. It covers crucial features such as multi-role dashboards, resume parsing, job matching, and API integration, making it a complete prototype for real-world job portals.
